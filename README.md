# iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional
The **iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional** course is run by an amazing group of instructors called Devslopes. I found this course through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) but you can also get it from their [website](https://devslopes.com/). 

It teaches the fundimentals and then some of iOS development using the Swift programming language. It also teaches how to use API's from Flickr's to a custom built one from Devslopes themselves. 

Below I have listed my progress and links to all the course repositories, as well as some Screenshots from the various apps. I have also noted what the app was teaching as well as any imported frameworks that are used (or API's).

The **iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional** course is run by an amazing group of instructors called Devslopes. I found this course through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) but you can also get it from their [website](https://devslopes.com/). 

It teaches the fundimentals and then some of iOS development using the Swift programming language. It also teaches how to use API's from Flickr's to a custom built one from Devslopes themselves. 

Below I have listed my progress and links to all the course repositories, as well as some Screenshots from the various apps. I have also noted what the app was teaching as well as any imported frameworks that are used (or API's).

Goal Post - the application that was built in section 7 has been published by me to the App Store. I am planning on implementing several features on top of the ones contributed in the course. If you have any suggestions for features to include, please add it as an issue above and tag it with Enhancement.

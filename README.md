# iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional
The **iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional** course is run by an amazing group of instructors called Devslopes. I found this course through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) but you can also get it from their [website](https://devslopes.com/). 

It teaches the fundimentals and then some of iOS development using the Swift programming language. It also teaches how to use API's from Flickr's to a custom built one from Devslopes themselves. 

Below I have listed my progress and links to all the course repositories, as well as some Screenshots from the various apps. I have also noted what the app was teaching as well as any imported frameworks that are used (or API's).

## :basketball: Swoosh
Swoosh is an app designed to help us to start with learning the basics of the iOS design language. It is a simple app which uses segues to traverse between a mock sign up page. 
As well as this it teaches us how to pass data between different views.

This is the first app you design in the course and touches on features such as creating stacks of objects and adding constraints to different views. We also created custom Views for the buttons, which added a basic outline around the outside of it. As well as the custom View, we also created a custom Model which would hold the Player data (if we continued on into a proper app).

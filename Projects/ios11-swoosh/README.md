# Swoosh
Swoosh is an app designed to help us to start with learning the basics of the iOS design language. It is a simple app which uses segues to traverse between a mock sign up page. 
As well as this it teaches us how to pass data between different views.

This is the first app you design in the course and touches on features such as creating stacks of objects and adding constraints to different views. We also created custom Views for the buttons, which added a basic outline around the outside of it. As well as the custom View, we also created a custom Model which would hold the Player data (if we continued on into a proper app).
